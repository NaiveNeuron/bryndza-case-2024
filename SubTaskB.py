SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
Analyze the following tweet and classify who the target of the hate speech is. Use the identified patterns and specific examples from the training data for classification. The categories are:

## Categories

1. Individual - Involves direct attacks on specific individuals. Common examples include derogatory remarks about individuals like "Trump" or "Greta Thunberg". Look for usage of individual names and personal attacks.

2. Organization - Involves criticisms targeted at larger entities such as governments, companies, or specific organizations. Key examples include attacks on 'Government', 'Big oil companies', 'Australia' (referring to its government), 'Wilderness Committee', and the 'EU'. Look for mentions of these entities and critiques of their policies or actions.

3. Community - Involves attacks on broader communities or societal groups. Typical terms used include 'White, middle class, educated, low earners', 'humans', 'adult society', and 'politicians'. This category shifts the focus from a single party to collective human behavior, demographic groups, or societal constructs.

Use chain of thought reasoning to explain your classification. After analyzing the tweet, classify it as "Prediction: 1" for an individual, "Prediction: 2" for an organization, or "Prediction: 3" for a community. Pick only one option and put it on a new line.

## Examples

Input tweet: #GlobalWarming #FridaysForFuture   #ClimateChange #Greenwashing #Renewables  #ClimateStrike  #ExtinctionRebellion #ClimateCrisis  #ClimateAction        

You've been fooled by Greta Thunberg:

Prediction: 1

Input tweet: So now the Palm Oil Industry is trying to rebrand deforestation as ""reforestation""..

I can't describe how angry this makes me!

When will humanity learn that advertising doesn't fix the crisis we are in!?!

#ExtinctionRebellion #TalkingClimate @Lets_Discuss_CC #FridaysForFuture

Prediction: 2

Input tweet: #FridaysforFuture question:

The global north is engaged in worldwide brain-drain of global south - good thing or bad?

Prediction: 3

Input tweet: #FridaysForFuture #ExtinctionRebellion 
How Naomi Klein, Josh Fox, 
George Monbiot, Ketan Joshi,  and many more lie to us

Every day. On  #ClimateChange &amp; #GlobalWarming!

It's #Greenwashing &amp; these people keep lying to us about real green technology emissions, #ClimateAction:

Prediction: 1

Input tweet: +++ GLOBAL CLIMATE STRIKE +++
#FridaysForFuture
The Global South is being ransacked by the Global North, citizens are being exploited by energy giants and the atmosphere is colonised in the name of growth.

We need to uproot this system NOW!! ðŸ”¥

#LossAndDamage 
#ClimateJustice https://t.co/EFVVxnTow1

Prediction: 2

Input tweet: To all the climate activists out there who aren't vegan.

You are denying the fact that animal agriculture is an ecological disaster.

If you want change, you have to be the change yourself.

Please go vegan, now!

#vegan #govegan 
#climatechange 
#kiimakrise
#fridaysforfuture https://t.co/in4MvsZA7E

Prediction: 3

Input tweet: we have to wage war against fossil fuel companies because they are earning from the destruction of our planet  @GretaThunberg @vanessa_vash #climatejusticenow #ClimateAction #environmentalprotection #FridaysForFuture #ClimateEmergency #UprootTheSystem https://t.co/8YPuhUXcgm

Prediction: 2

Input tweet: These youth put us all to shame #FridaysForFuture
